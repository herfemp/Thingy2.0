# Thingy2.0

This code is crap, a toy, not to be seen etc etc. I only use it for toying.


It can do one thing and one thing only. BDM flash Trionic EXTREMELY fast.

Take a look in bdmdrivers. Subtract 25 percent or more from those times and you know how fast this, whetever it is, is.

Dump of T5.5 in < 1.5 S.

Flash of 39sf020 (512K) in 5,3 S.

Flash of AM28F010 (150 nS) in 5,1 S.



There is some code for CAN flashing in it but i've only used it for other purposes. As such it is not functional



Have fun.. :)
