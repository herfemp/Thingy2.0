# Thingy2.0

This code is crap, a toy, not to be seen etc etc. I only use it for toying.


It can do one thing and one thing only. BDM-flash Trionic _EXTREMELY_ fast.

Take a look in bdmdrivers/driverhost. Subtract 25 percent or more from those times and you know how fast this, whetever it is, is.

Dump of T5.5 in < 1,5 S.

Flash of 39sf020 (512K, Mirror T5.5) in 5,3 S.

Flash of AM28F010 (150 nS) in 5,1 S.

Flash of TN28F010 in 4,8 S.

Flash of 29C010 in 1,3 - 5,5 S.




There is some code for CAN flashing in it but i've only used it for other purposes. As such it is not functional.



Have fun.. :)
